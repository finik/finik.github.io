        <p>In this post I continue the analysis of Auzzle, the magnetic puzzle by Ilya Osipov and attempt to come up with a simple to remember solution involving only one algorithm to remember. See my <a href="/2018/12/24/Auzzle-Puzzle/">first</a> post for the background initial analysis.</p>
<h2 id="Notation">Notation</h2>
<p>We will try to adopt a common notation used in Rubik’s cube. The difference is our R and L in Auzzle always rotate by full 180 degrees, so we won’t use R’ and L’.</p>
<p><img src="/images/auzzle/notation.png" alt="Notation"></p>
<h2 id="One_algorithm">One algorithm</h2>
<p>As I shown in my previous post, it is always possible to get to one of the solved state within 10 moves (in fact most of the combinations can be solved in 5-7 moves), however our goal here is different, what we would like is to come up with one basic, intuitive and easy to remember algorithm, which, when applied properly, would help us solve the puzzle. There are multiple ways to go about it, but here one of them:</p>
<p><img src="/images/auzzle/algorithm.png" alt="Algorithm"></p>
<p>What does it do? It just swaps top left and right segments on the front. Side effect: top and bottom segments in the right back quadrant are being swapped too. Left back quadrant is being left completely untouched. That means, if you have some segments paired, keeping them in the back and performing the algorithm above will not break the pairing, and the side effect can pretty much be ignored too.</p>
<h2 id="Phase_1:_Getting_to_one_pair">Phase 1: Getting to one pair</h2>
<p>It doesn’t look like any algorithms are needed here. Just rotate either top (T) or bottom (B) wheels and you will likely get at least one pair matched, if you don’t after making a full circle, rotate one half vertically (R) or (L) and then rotate (T) or (B) again, you WILL get some pairs matched.</p>
<p>If you are really lucky, you got all 4 matched, congratulations, the puzzle is solved. If you got two pairs matched, you can skip phase 2 and go directly to phase 3.</p>
<h2 id="Phase_2:_Getting_second_pair">Phase 2: Getting second pair</h2>
<p>Remember how we said our magic algorithm doesn’t really mess up anything in the back? So we can put our matched pair in the back left or right quadrant and try performing the algorithm to swap pieces at the front, until we get our second pair matched. The problem is, it won’t always work :) In order to explain why, I will use 4 different colors, as before, to represent 4 different matching pairs. Lets see some cases:</p>
<p><img src="/images/auzzle/secondpair.png" alt="Second pair"></p>
<p>Of course, on a real Auzzle we don’t see any colors, and for now, until a better method is found, we are operating in the dark. However, we can see in theory, there are 2 main cases here:</p>
<p>Case A: This is the easy one, it doesn’t matter where we put our first matched pair (red). We can put it on the right back or left back (A2 is just A1 that has both top and bottom wheels shifted to the right), but the moment  we perform our algorithm, we will get second pair matched, in A1 it will be the green match, in A2 the blue one.</p>
<p>Case B: This case is not that lucky. It doesn’t matter where we keep our matched red pair and how we rotate the puzzle. Performing the algorithm will not result in any new pairs being created, period. The easiest way is, when you see second pair doesn’t appear no matter what you do, to unpair the first pair by performing one click of one of the wheels, perform the algoritm and look for a new first pair again. (TBD, this works so far, but needs a better, more deterministic method).</p>
<h2 id="Phase_3:_Last_two_pairs">Phase 3: Last two pairs</h2>
<p>Ok, we got 2 pairs matched, just bring them both to the back, and lets work with the unmatched pieces at the front. There are two ways how 2 pairs can be potentially unmatched (see diagram below). On a real Auzzle we obviously won’t see green and red segment colors like in the diagram below, but we can see the magnets interaction and infer the case we are dealing with:</p>
<p><img src="/images/auzzle/final.png" alt="Final"></p>
<p>Case A: The easiest one is when we notice an asymmetrical configuration of the magents. The pieces are crossed! We can just perform our magic algorithm to swap to top left and right pieces and the puzzle is solved!</p>
<p>Case B: This one is a bit trickier. The left and the right side are clearly symmetrical. That tells us the pieces are not crossed. Swapping two top ones will not help us much, we will end up exactly where we started. We need to break the “parity” of the puzzle and get to the Case A we love so much.</p>
<p>There are also two magnet configuration which don’t tell us whether we are in A or B. In this case it is safe to perform our basic algorithm for Case A, and if puzzle is not solved, just continue with a more advanced algorithm for Case B.</p>
<p><code>In fact, if you would rather not think at all about Case A or Case B and dont&#39; care about few extra twists, you can always try to perform the algorithm for A, and if the puzzle is not solved continue to B (i.e</code></p>
<p>I am sure there are more effective ways to solve the puzzle with less (5-7) moves, even just memorizing and using all the mirror variations of our basic algorithm above would make a huge difference and save tons of unnecessary moves. Phase 2 should be improved too. It’s a start, stay tuned for updates.  </p>

        <p>Below are my notes and a quick brute force scanning of the rotating puzzle called Auzzle by Ilya Osipov.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I do not own one. All the work below is my attempt to analyze it after having the pleasure to see and play with a prototype for a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="Theory">Theory</h2>
<p>At first glance the puzzle looks quite overwhelming. It consists of 24 magnets, arranged in pairs, and depending on the polarity of the magnets in the pair, they are either pulled towards the middle, or pushed towards the outer edges. The wooden or plastic pieces holding these magnets can be rotated in multiple directions, constantly changing the matching between the magnets. The puzzle is solved only when all 12 pairs of magnets are pulled towards the middle.</p>
<p>After further inspection, however, it becomes clear that the things are not as bad as they seem. There are actually only 8 unique solid wooden or plastic pieces, each one containing 3 magnets. In other words, only 4 pairs of 2 pieces each. The placement of the magnets within each piece is unique, we can actually represent it as a binary encoding, 1 if the magnets ‘+’ is pointing towards the center, and 0 if ‘+’ points towards the outer edge. Unsurprisingly, 3 bits is the exact number required to encode 8 unique pieces: #0=000, #1=001, #2=010, #3=011, #4=100, #5=101, #6=110, #7=111.</p>
<p>Therefore, each piece has only one and only one matching piece resulting in all 3 pairs of magnets pulling towards the middle.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/finik/AuzzlePuzzle/raw/master/magnets.jpg" alt="Magnets"></p>
<p>If we keep thinking in binary, in order for a pair of pieces to be each others matching counterparts, the following condition has to be true:</p>
<p><strong>A xor reversed(B) == 7</strong></p>
<p><code>It is easy to overlook the &quot;reversed&quot; part, but it is important! We encode every piece in the same way, 1 always means &#39;+&#39; pole is oriented towards the center. Pieces will change their orientation, sometimes they will face up and sometimes down, but when faced each other, we can&#39;t operate directly on their encodings, we must remember the top one is upside down (i.e piece 001 (1) will atract magnets in the 110 (6) formation, however the actual encoding of that opposing top piece is 011 (3))</code></p>
<p>In other words, in order to solve the puzzle, piece #0 must be placed against piece #7, #4 against #6, #1 against #3 and #2 against #5.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/finik/AuzzlePuzzle/raw/master/solution.jpg" alt="Solution"></p>
<h3 id="Total_combinations">Total combinations</h3>
<p>Total amount of permutations for 8 unique pieces is 8! = 40,320</p>
<p>We also need to multiply it by 2 to account for two possible states of the outer shell in relation to the internal mechanism.</p>
<p>However if we take any state of the puzzle, whether we rotate it by 180 degrees along X or rotate it in any of the 4 orentations along axis Y, it is still the same state, we don’t want to count each state 8 times, so we divide by 8 respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Total number of combinations: 8! x 2 / 8 = 10,080</strong></p>
<p>What about possible solutions?</p>
<p>The picture above shows only one possible solution of the puzzle. However it immediately becomes clear that the puzzle has many possible solutions: a) within each pair, the two pieces can swap places; b) the position of the pairs relative to one another can change and the puzzle would still remain solved. </p>
<p>Permitations to place 2 matching pieces within a pair: 2</p>
<p>We have 4 of these pairs, so total number of permutations is 2^4</p>
<p>Number of ways to place pairs in relation to one another: 4!</p>
<p>Similarly to how we did it before, we multiple by 2 to account for 2 possible states of the outer edge.</p>
<p>And, again, divide by 8 to account for rotation of the whole construction and avoid counting each state as 8 different ones.</p>
<p><strong>Total number of solutions: 4! x 2^4 x 2 / 8 = 96</strong></p>
<p><strong>Observation #1</strong>: It is possible to screw up the assembly of the puzzle and insert magnets in a way that will result in pieces with identical encodings existing within the same puzzle. The number of possible solved combinations will increase, the total number of combinations will decrease. Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>Observation #2</strong>: In a proper puzzle that actually has 8 uniquely encoded pieces, it is IMPOSSIBLE to get to a state where all the 12 pairs are pushed towards the outer edges. Piece #0 (000) will only push all 3 magnets when paired with another #0, and since there should be only one #0 piece in the puzzle that should never happen. This is true for any encoding that is a ‘palyndrome’ in a 3bit range (i.e #0, #2, #5, #7) (see <a href="#4bit">4bit</a> variation for a way to possibly do it with 4 bits)</p>
<h2 id="Practice">Practice</h2>
<p>In order to validate my theory and also calculate the <strong>God’s Number</strong> (maximum number of moves God has to perform to get to a solved state), I’ve written a simple simulator that tries to scan all possible states by doing it in reverse, starting with a solved state and traversing the tree of all the possible states. The code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/finik/AuzzlePuzzle/blob/master/sim.py" target="_blank" rel="external">sim.py</a>. It starts at the at the initial solved state shown in the picture above, then performs a BFS’ish scan of the whole space by performing all possible operations. For every state, to avoid double counting rotations (remember the division by 8), it rotates the whole puzzle to a <strong>canonical</strong> state where piece #0 is inside the lower left quadrant. </p>

<p>I am sure it can be done much more efficiently, but that was a quick and dirty exercise and it proves my theoretical calulations (the numbers match!). It also reveals the God’s Number for Auzzle, that number is 10! 10 moves is all it takes to get from the worst position to one of the 96 solved states.</p>
<h2 id="Actually_solving_it">Actually solving it</h2>
<p>TBD :)</p>
<p>Given the total number of combinations and the total number of solutions, it is actually pretty easy to get to one of the solved states just by fidgeting with the puzzle enough time.</p>
<p>If we mark the matching pieces with 4 different colors like in the picture above, the puzzle is trivial to solve systematically. In fact, we can think of it as a subset of a 2x2x2 cube where one axis rotates only by 180 and another axis doesn’t rotate at all. </p>
<p>However, individual pieces are not marked and the only thing that can be observed externally by looking at the magnets is the result of the interaction between two adjustent pieces (representing <strong>A xor reversed(B)</strong>). This  makes it much more challenging. I would love to get get my hands on one to see if there is a way to properly formulate an algorithm for a solution.</p>
<h2 id="Variations">Variations</h2>
<h3 id="4bit">4bit</h3>
<p>In this variant, we have more possible encodings (16) than needed to represent 8 unique pieces, however that allows us to skip encodings that require duplicated pieces:</p>
<p>a) Avoid encodings #0, #6, #9 and #15 (#0 will only fully push away another #0, etc)</p>
<p>b) Avoid encodings #5, #3, #10, #12 (#5 will only fully pull another #5, etc)</p>
<p>That leaves with 8 encodings that do not have any of the issues above, each one of them has a proper counterpart for pulling all 4 of its magnets and and another one of pushing all 4. These encodings are: #1, #2, #4, #7, #8, #11, #13 and #14. And the actual matching pairs for both solutions are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>All magnets pulled inside:</strong> (#1, #7), (#8, #14), (#2, #11), (#4, #13)</p>
<p><strong>All magnets pushed outside:</strong> (#1, #8), (#2, #4), (#7, #14), (#11, #13)</p>
<p>It would be logical to assume the total amount of combination will not change (the amount of pieces did not change, it is still 8). The amount of solution states should probably double to 192 (96 inside and 96 outside), and the God’s number should probably decrease by 1 as well (worst case should probably be only 9 moves away from one of the solved states). To test it, I’ve duplicated the simulation and modified it to work with the 4bit encodings above, the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/finik/AuzzlePuzzle/blob/master/sim-4bits.py" target="_blank" rel="external">sim-4bit.py</a></p>
